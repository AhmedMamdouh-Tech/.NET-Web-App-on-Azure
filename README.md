#  a web project I recently built using .NET that displays a list of courses. I used several Microsoft Azure services to bring it all together:

🔹 Azure SQL Database – I used this to store the course information like names and descriptions. It’s secure, fast, and works well with websites.

🔹 Azure Storage Account – I uploaded course images here. It keeps pictures separate from the database, making the site faster and easier to manage.

🔹 Azure App Service – I used this to publish and run my website in the cloud. It made deployment simple and supports automatic updates and monitoring.

🛠️ This project helped me learn how to connect different Azure tools to create a working web app — just like real-world cloud development#
